Most people are [[wage slaves]]. 
- The dire need for the next paycheck makes them unable to pursue a better job, unable to leave their current one even if the conditions are horrid. Unable to pursue their own personal interests, or [[Self actualization]].



Most people are motivated to care about _unfulfilling things_
- [[consumerism]] creates a [[culture]] of "Keeping up with the Jones's"
	- This pursuit of material happiness is ultimately unfulfilling, but [[addiction|addictive]] nonetheless [^1]
	

## These are motivated by [[Capitalism]]
- [[Capitalism]] perpetuates [[consumerism]] because more spending makes more money for those who pull the levers of [[society]]. 

- And [[capitalists]] perpetuate the conditions for [[wage slaves|wage slavery]] because employees who have *no choice* will work for *less pay* and *worse conditions*, allowing [[capitalists]] to extract more profit.

## These lead to a less happy, less fulfilled [[society]]
- Less educated
- Less healthy
- Less overall [[well-being]]
